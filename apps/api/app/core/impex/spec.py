"""Impex descriptors — how a module opts an entity into CSV import/export (issue #77).

The same shape as custom fields (§13) and panels (§6): **core owns the mechanics** — CSV
parsing/serialisation, validation, dry-run, upsert orchestration, the routes — and a module
only **describes its shape** here, declaring it on its :class:`~app.registry.ModuleDescriptor`.
A new attachable module gets import/export by writing one descriptor, no core edits.

Vocabulary:

* An :class:`ImpexColumn` is one CSV column. Headers are the **stable keys**, never localized
  labels, so an export re-imports cleanly into the same org (round-trip). The tenant's custom
  fields (§13) are *not* declared here — core appends them at request time from the definitions,
  keyed by definition ``key``.
* ``natural_key`` names the column the import upserts on (company: ``name``, contact:
  ``email``): a match updates, no match creates. Never a raw ``id`` — ids don't survive a trip
  through a spreadsheet, names and emails do.
* ``fk_resolvers`` turn a human reference (an exact name, or a UUID) into a tenant-scoped id.
  An unresolved or ambiguous reference is a **row error**, never a silent orphan.

Every callable receives the tenant-bound :class:`~app.core.tenancy.RequestContext` and must go
through the module's own service/repository — the descriptor is a shape, not a data path
(Golden Rule 1).
